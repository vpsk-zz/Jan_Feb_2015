= Generating Native applications
prabhu@durasoftindia.com

== Step I
--> Create an application in *jQuery Mobile*. Have an 'index.html' file with the js and css files included +
   (or) +
--> Create an application in *Sencha Touch*. You can use *Sencha Cmd* for that. Run the following commands after installing Sencha Cmd. 

****
Sencha Cmd requires *Ruby* runtime, so you need to install Ruby for Sencha Cmd to work.
****

*sencha -sdk <path to touch-x.y.z folder> generate app <NameOfTheApplication> <path to the application>*

The above command generates a blank sencha touch application with the mvc folders created. Edit the code and run it locally in a web server during development.

*sencha app build production*

This command compresses the whole application, generates one js file(app.js) and gives you the application ready to be deployed.

== Step II

--> After developing the application you can now generate a native application in the following ways.

1) You can upload a zip file on the *PhoneGap cloud*. Go to http://build.phonegap.com and create an account. Upload the zip file of your application. You get the neccessary native files ready to be installed in your devices.

(OR)

2) You can use *Apache cordova* to generate native executables. You need to setup Cordova in your development machine.

*  Install Node JS
*  Install JDK (for Android)
*  Install ANT (for Android)
*  Install Cordova

*npm install -g cordova* +

*  npm config set proxy http://login:pass@proxy.company.com:8080
*  npm config set https-proxy http://login:pass@proxy.company.com:8080
*  Create a project in cordova

+cordova create <ProjectName> <PackageName> <ApplicationName>+
It will download a 'www' folder.

* Inside the www folder paste your jQM or Sencha Touch application code.

* Add the platform for which you need to generate an executable using the command

+cordova platform add <platformname>+  where <platformname> is either *Android* or *ios* or *blackberry*  and so on.

* Build your application to generate the native executables using

+cordova build+

* To run in it in an emulator 

+cordova emulate <platformname>+ where <platformname> is Android or ios ...etc.
