Create a Sencha Touch application by generating a new project called ‘Quiz’ using Sencha Cmd. The application is a simple arithmetic quiz app. 


== Step: 1

You have to implement your webserver to return 5 simple arithmetic questions with answers, randomly from a set of say 10 questions. When you send the request to /QandA you should send a JSON array of 5 questions. The format of JSON is left to you.


== Step: 2

Implement the screens using Sencha Architect. Take a look at the screen shots.
